I am generally interested in understanding the causes of variation in life history traits in wild populations, with particular on the causes and consequences of within-individual variation in life history. The focus of my research is the evolutionary ecology of reproductive strategies and understanding the impact of environmental variation on adaptation and evolution of traits.
