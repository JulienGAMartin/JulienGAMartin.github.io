The research in Julien Martin's laboratory is mainly focusing on the importance of evolutionary processes in shaping current wild population of animals and how current environmental conditions are influencing the evolution of wild animals. The name for the lab (:zany_face: **MAD** :zany_face:) has diverse origins. Some says it is an acronym of Marmot and Alpine swift Data since most of the research is based on 2 unique long-term research studies on yellow-bellied marmots and alpine swifts. Others says it is because we are doing crazy :exploding_head:  complex models or maybe it is because I just like to take a fun twist on life :zany_face:
