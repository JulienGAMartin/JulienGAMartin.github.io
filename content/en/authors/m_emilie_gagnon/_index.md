I study the habitat selection of Antillean manatees (Trichechus manatus manatus) in Sian Ka'an, southeastern Mexico. I am identifying the important environmental variables explaining manatee presence at both a fine and large spatial scale. For my statistical anaylses, I use generalized linear mixed models with a Bayesian approach.
