I am generally interested in understanding the causes of variation in life history traits in wild populations, with particular on the causes and consequences of within-individual variation in life history. The focus of my research is the evolutionary ecology of reproductive strategies and understanding the impact of environmental variation on adaptation and evolution of traits.

My doctoral project focuses on exploring within-individual residual variance. Using quantitative genetic tools, I wish to assess the prevalence and importance of variation in within-individual residual variance in natural systems for multiple traits and species. The objective is to better understand among-individual variation and the evolutionary implications of within-individual residual variance in maintaining or limiting phenotypic variation.
