During her PhD, Svenja investigated the causes and consequences of life-history trait variation in relation to senescence, and in the context of different spatio-temporal environments. Specifically, she was looking at senescence in female marmot body mass and reproductive success, and at transgenerational effects of senescence. As part of her PhD, Svenja spent two summers in the Colorado Rocky Mountains to collect data for the yellow-bellied marmot long-term study. She is a marmoteer at heart, and her favourite marmot is Dandelion (aka Dandy), a handsome and bold male whom Svenja named after his fondness for dandelions. Generally, Svenjaâ€™s research interests span a broad range of topics, including life-history evolution, senescence, transgenerational effects, phenology, conservation biology and ecology, and sexual selection. Svenja is currently based on Bioko, a small island in the Gulf of Guinea, where she is working with the Bioko Biodiversity Protection Programme (BBPP) and setting up a course to teach R coding to local people.
