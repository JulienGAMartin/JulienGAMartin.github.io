I am a PhD candidate and Graduate Fellow at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory in Colorado, where I am studying the molecular ecology of hibernation and phenological shifts under climate change in yellow-bellied marmots! I am interested in leveraging long-term data to investigate epigenetic aging and regulatory genomics in wild mammals of all kinds.

I am generally interested in understanding the causes of variation in life history traits in wild populations, with particular on the causes and consequences of within-individual variation in life history. The focus of my research is the evolutionary ecology of reproductive strategies and understanding the impact of environmental variation on adaptation and evolution of traits.
