My research interests are general evolution (at the phenotypic level) in natural environments, with a particular interest in Behaviour, Predation and Mammals. For my PhD, my research focuses on a major phenotypic shift in the Yellow-Bellied marmots system. I am seeking to understand the causes and consequences of the observed body mass increase in the last half-century.
