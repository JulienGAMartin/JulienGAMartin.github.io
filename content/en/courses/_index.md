# Biostatistic courses at uOttawa {#biostat}

Here is a short description of the course I am teaching at the University of Ottawa. For more details about the course consult the following page [Biostats-uottawa](https://biostats-uottawa.github.io) and the site for each course

### Applied biostatistics with R (BIO 4X58)

* Offered to both undergraduate and graduate students in english and french
* Prerequisite:
  * an introduction class to statisticis is good to have
  * No (or limited) knowledge of R and no (or limited) knowledge of stats expected.
* BIO4158 english ([Course site](https://biostats-uottawa.github.io/bio4158_course/) / [Course manual](https://biostats-uottawa.github.io/bio4158_manual/))
* BIO4558 french ([Course site](https://biostats-uottawa.github.io/bio4558_cours/) / [Course manual](https://biostats-uottawa.github.io/bio4558_manuel/))

### Advanced biostatistics and open science (BIO 8940)

* Bilingual course for graduate students
* Prerequisite:
  * a functional knowledge of R (loading data, running basic linear models, and making plots)
  * a good understanding of linear models
  * essentially Bio8940 is a great next steps after completing Bio4x58.
* [Course site](https://biostats-uottawa.github.io/bio8940_course/) / [Course manual](https://biostats-uottawa.github.io/bio8940_manual/)

# Statistical consulting {#consult}

As Part of my service, I provide statistical consulting.
Please just contact me to book an appointment to discuss your stat problems.

Please bring with you (or send me in advance):

* your data
* your R code (should at least load the data into R)
* a clear working hypothesis

Statistical consulting does not mean that you have to add me as a co-author. I just ask that you add me to the **"Acknowledgements"** of your thesis and manuscript/article. Repeated consulting on the same problem and my implication on developing project specific coding/analysis might lead to co-authorship, but this usually all comes naturally and is always discussed openly with the student(s) and PI(s). As yet, I have never requested to become a co-author and I was offered co-authorship for 3 manuscripts over > 50 projects discussed.



# Tutorials {#tut}

## Home made tutorials

### An introduction to R

* english ([course](https://biostats-uottawa.github.io/intro_r_fr.html) / [course manual](https://biostats-uottawa.github.io/R_way))
* french ([course](https://biostats-uottawa.github.io/intro_r_fr.html) / [course manual](https://biostats-uottawa.github.io/chemin_R))

### Quantitative genetic

* [An introduction to the Animal model using multiple software](https://juliengamartin.github.io/wam_tuto/)

## List of other tutorials I like

- Based on `stan`
  - [SocialAnimal model](https://jordan-scott-martin.github.io/Social-Animal-Models/) by Jordan Scott Martin
  - [Non-linear selection on behavioral reaction norms](https://github.com/Jordan-Scott-Martin/Selection-on-RNs) by Jordan Scott Martin tutorials

* Based on `MCMCglmm`
  - [QGglmm](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/QGglmm/vignettes/QGglmmHowTo.pdf) by Pierre de Villemereuil
  - [MCMCglmm](https://devillemereuil.legtux.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tuto_en.pdf) by Pierre de Villemereuil


# Quarto templates {#quarto}

A few quarto templates I developed to facilitate open-science for students at uOttawa

* [bio-uo-proposal](https://github.com/JulienGAMartin/quarto-bio-uo-proposal):  
  quarto extension providing 1 new pdf output format (`bio-uo-proposal-pdf`). I am working on a docx version but tweaking the frontpage is tricky with word document.

* [bio-uo-thesis](https://github.com/JulienGAMartin/quarto-bio-uo-thesis):  
  quarto extension  providing two new output formats for book projects: an html (`bio-uo-thesis-html`) and a pdf (`bio-uo-thesis-pdf`) generating a website (to be hosted on github pages or similar) and a pdf of the thesis adequately formatted for uOttawa (at least biology)

Some extra:

* [quarto-bw-board-revealjs](https://github.com/JulienGAMartin/quarto-bw-board-revealjs):  
  quarto template for revealjs slides for a white- or black-board style with associated `ggplot` theme
