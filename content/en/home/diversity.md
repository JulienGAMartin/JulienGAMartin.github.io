All the research in the lab is essentially framed around the power of individual variation and individual uniqueness to shape and drive the future of a population and how the past of a populaton has lead to the individual variation we observe now. Recognizing the value and power of individual differences is absolutely fundamental in all species, and especially in humans. As an academic and supervisor, I am passionate about creating an inclusive workplace that promotes and values equality and diversity. I am hoping to create an environment in the lab where: everyone is welcome, everyone can do their best work and everyone feel perfectly happy to share their ideas regardless of their background and academic level.
