The lab pledge to reproducible science:

1. I will teach my graduate students about reproducibility and open science.
2. For all results in a paper, we will share data, code for analysis & plotting script
3. We will release code at the time of submission of a paper.
4. We will add a "Reproducibility" declaration in each paper with DOI link to code and data.

<!--2. All our research code is under version control.-->
<!--4. We will upload the preprint to arXiv at the time of submission of a paper.-->
