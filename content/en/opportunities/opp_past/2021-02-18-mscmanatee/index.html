<h1>Project</h1>
<p>Using well known population of manatees along the east coast of Mexico, the project will be looking at the variation in foraging behaviour with reproductive status in manatees using a spatial ecology approach based on aerial imaging. Data collection will be done from the shore using aerial imaging from a small UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle).</p>
<p>The project will be supervised by <strong>Julien Martin</strong> (uOttawa, Canada). The project will be done in collaboration with <strong>Guillaume Rieucau</strong> (<a href="https://www.guillaumerieucau.com/">LUMCON, USA</a>) and <strong>Nataly Castelblanco-Mart√≠nez</strong> (<a href="https://finsconservation.org/">FINS</a>). The student will be based at the Biology department of the University of Ottawa and will participate to field work in Mexico during the summer.</p>
