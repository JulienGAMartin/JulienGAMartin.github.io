<!-- a bit about you and your project here-->

Gabi obtained a travelling from UCLA to spend 2 weeks in the lab to work on her project on DNA methylation and hibernation in marmots. The project was to test the hibernation hypothesis on aging that predict a slowing down or even reversal of aging processes during hibernation.
