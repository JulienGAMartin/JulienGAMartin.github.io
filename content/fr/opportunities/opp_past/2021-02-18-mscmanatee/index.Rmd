# Project
Using well known population of manatees along the east coast of Mexico, the project will be looking at the variation in foraging behaviour with reproductive status in manatees using a spatial ecology approach based on aerial imaging. Data collection will be done from the shore using aerial imaging from a small UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle).  

The project will be supervised by **Julien Martin** (uOttawa, Canada). The project will be done in collaboration with **Guillaume Rieucau** ([LUMCON, USA](https://www.guillaumerieucau.com/)) and **Nataly Castelblanco-Mart√≠nez** ([FINS](https://finsconservation.org/)). The student will be based at the Biology department of the University of Ottawa and will participate to field work in Mexico during the summer.
