However, recent studies in captivity showed that within-individual variance could in fact have a genetic basis. In addition, several studies on captive animal have shown the evolutionary importance of the genetic variance in individual variation. For examples, animal breeding try to select for milking cows with low daily variation in milk production to facilitate stock prediction and management. So if we start to understand the importance and the interest of the genetic basis of within-individual variation in breeding programs, the evolutionary importance of this genetic component remain relatively unknown in the wild. Consequently, to better understand evolution in the wild it is key to evaluate the existence and quantify the amount of genetic variance in the intra-individual variance of traits and how it correlates with other traits including fitness. Ideally to get a wider understanding of the phenomenon, such study would need to look at multiple type of traits and across multiple species. Since this has rarely been done, to get a better understanding this needs to be evaluated across multiple traits and species. The aim of this project is to used new quantitative genetic models, a statistical approach allowing to estimate the genetic variance in a trait in wild population, to quantify the genetic variation in within-individual variance in multiple traits across at least 5 species using long-term pedigreed natural populations including yellow-bellied marmots, alpine swifts, eastern chipmunks, bighorn sheep and red squirrels. The project will thus be based on over 150 years of field work (combined across all species). This project will offer opportunity to learn a variety of important methods in evolutionary biology and to participate in the field work on the marmot system. The student will be given a thorough training in field skills and in statistical modelling to tease apart the amount of trait variance explained by genetic and environmental effects.\n Relevant publications  Prentice PM, Houslay TM, Martin JGA, Wilson AJ. 2020 Genetic variance for behavioural ‘predictability’ of stress response.

More specifically I will use a quantitative genetic approach to study changes in traits \u0026amp; distribution and variance due to changes in the environment\nResearch methods Long-term monitoring Long-term studies are the best way to track changes in the environment and quantify their consequences for population dynamics and fitness consequences of quantitative phenotypic traits, two key components of understanding the impacts of climate change. Although I highly value this approach to study ecological and evolutionary questions, it provides results that are correlative and not causative as one could obtain with an experiment. On the other hand, experimentation on life-history trade-offs or selection in the wild are nearly impossible when studying long-lived animals.\nUnmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) UAVs offer the ability to collect new data non-invasively, and quite rapidly over a small to medium scale of the environment. I am mainly using aerial mappinig type of data to estiamte habitat quality and size, identity animals at the individual level and precisely map them. If a flight could fairly be quick, the post-processing of the data collected could be gigantic.\nStatistics  mixed model animal model random regression double hierarchical model path analysis social network analysis geostatistical analysis  Past projects Orangutan Nest Watch We fly drones over an area of Forest in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo in order to find out how orangutans are affected by human impacts on their environment. Orangutans are Critically Endangered and it is vital to protect their remaining habitat. However we do not yet know at what population densities they live, so we need to search through each individual photo to see if we can find their nests and their vital food source- strangler fig trees. The more we know about the habitat orangutans can survive in, the more we can build to protect suitable areas of forest where they can live into the future, and reduce the threat of local extinction. Find out more at project site  but more importantly volunteer and help us by participating on the Zooniverse project\nSpatial and social structure at harbour seal haul-out sites using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) I am interested in the social structure and spatial distribution of seals at haul out sites. Due to heavy logistics, simple data such as individual body condition, distance between neighbours and identity of neighbour are rarely known in seal studies. Using UAVs, I am able to measure, identity and map precisely seals hauling out. I am looking at stabilty of social structure throughout the seasons and years, as well as habitat selection at small scale for haul out site.\nPersonality in long-lived fulmars and its impact on foraging strategies and reproduction Using a long-term study of fulmars at Eynhallow, Orkney Islands, UK, I am looking at the between individual variation in docility and agressiveness and their consequences on reproductive output.\nReproductive strategies of Bighorn ewes For my PhD, I worked on reproductive strategies of bighorn sheep females with Pr. Marco Festa-Bianchet. I was interested in how adult females allocate energy to reproduction or to survival under different conditions. In few words, bighorn females always favor their own body condition and survival over the ones of their lambs.\nPersonality in wild eastern chipmunk I have done my M.Sc on personality in wild chipmunks under the supervision of Pr. Denis Réale. My main interest was to establish if individuals differed in their behaviour in a stressful situation and how these differences were related to hormones and human disturbance\n","date":1561939200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561939200,"objectID":"fb91af3bfa3616a23850245b905650e8","permalink":"/project/old_page/","publishdate":"2019-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/old_page/","section":"project","summary":"Research projects page in need of love and pictures","tags":["marmots","swifts"],"title":"Research projects","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-243302400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-243302400,"objectID":"e3dce48ebb0195e71e2029e1cd299d57","permalink":"/project/yb_rmbl_dan/","publishdate":"1962-04-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/yb_rmbl_dan/","section":"project","summary":"Long-term research project on yellow-bellied marmots at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory.","tags":["main"],"title":"Yellow-bellied marmots long-term research with Dan Blumstein","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"/contact/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/contact/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"4893ea0e9165cb53310bd3278fb87fa4","permalink":"/people/alumni/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/people/alumni/","section":"people","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"4fd68168c337c9172dbbde10aefd29dd","permalink":"/people/people/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/people/people/","section":"people","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"632af6afa9dd71735876f1e3ce748dec","permalink":"/people/visiting/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/people/visiting/","section":"people","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f1d044c0738ab9f19347f15c290a71a1","permalink":"/research/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"}]
